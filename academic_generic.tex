\begin{rSection}{Research Interests}

Highly motivated biochemistry student, with an interest in computational biology, seeking to develop my research and computational skills. The application of next generation sequencing (NGS) and other "omics" technologies to study complex biological systems is fascinating, and fraught with computational challenges. 

Having discovered a fascination for programming during my degree, I began learning about computer science and bioinformatics before applying my skills to the development of an R package for the identification of Pack-TYPE transposable elements; these elements acquire chromosomal DNA after incomplete excisions of closely spaced repeats and are poorly predicted in annotation studies. "packFinder" facilitates the detection of these transposons, which have important implications in the evolution of host genes. 

My dissertation currently involves development of the python package "Metaboverse" which attempts to expand the search space of small molecules for untargeted metabolomics experiments. Improved automated annotation of metabolites will improve the standard workflows for the growing field of metabolomics; improvements in high-throughput technologies will lead to the possibility of improved multi-omics integration.

After comparing these projects to my experience in industry, it is clear that I thrive in an academic environment at the frontier of human knowledge; therefore, I would like to pursue a PhD where I may conduct my own research and contribute to my fields of interest. As a biologist with a passion for computation and the "omics" technologies, I am particularly keen to develop my programming and technical skills. My skillset, previous research experience and tenacious nature will make me a commited and competent PhD candidate.

\begin{rSection}{Research Experience}

\begin{rSubsection}{A Prior Knowledge-Based Computational Workflow for \textit{de novo} Structural Elucidation of Small Molecules in Mass Spectrometry Metabolomics}{}{Dr Ralf Weber}{October 2019 - Present}
\item Extended an existing codebase for the generation of \textit{de novo} metabolites and refactored for PEP8 compliance. Developed my understanding of databases, data structures and algorithms for the optimisation of Metaboverse; used isomorphic graphs for the generation of molecules from substructures stored in SQLite databases.
\item Processed mass spectrometry metabolomics datasets for the validation of Metaboverse. Produced a pipeline for the generation of large substructure databases using a linux high performance computing cluster. 
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{An Automated Tool for \textit{de novo} Annotation of Pack-TYPE Non-Autonomous Transposable Elements}{}{Dr Marco Catoni}{August 2019 - Present}
\item Designed and implemented an R package to automatically detect transposable elements. Used command line and bioconductor tools to process sequence data. 
\item Adhered to R standard practices for the organisation, testing and documentation of packages; learned to use version control for the management of programming projects. 
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Development of an Immunoturbidimetric Assay for Serum Amyloid A}{}{The Binding Site}{August 2018 - August 2019}
\item Routinely used excel, and statistical packages such as Analyse-It/Minitab, to analyse and present data to co-workers and managers. 
\item Took responsibility for planning and carrying out experiments and statistical analyses in a research environment. Received training in scientific writing in order to routinely produce experimental write-ups for submission to regulatory bodies; this involved compliance to standard operating procedures.
\item Developed an assay for serum amyloid A for use in clinical laboratories; produced an extended literature review and project report before giving a presentation at the University of Birmingham based on my experiences.
